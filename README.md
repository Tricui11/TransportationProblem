The application solves the transport problem using two methods: the stepping stone method and the potentials method.

For the initial approximation, you can choose the rule of the northwest corner or the minimum price.

The application uses animation to visually display matrix transformations. The animation can be reset and resumed by pressing the pause/play buttons.
It should be noted that the potentials method does not always give a solution and can go in cycles. A check has been added to the program so that the application does not freeze. 
For example, on the screen, the potentials method did not work for the northwest corner rule, but it worked perfectly according to the rule of the lowest price!
